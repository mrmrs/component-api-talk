# Component API

I read a book one time called 'Refactoring your wetware'. There was an
interesting part about thinking about a problem as if you were looking at it
from 10 thousand feet up in the air. 

I was driving in Sunday morning traffic one time. I was on my way from San
Francisco to a flea market. The GPS in my car told me that coming up was an
exit I should take and that I should get into one of the two right lanes. About
a dozen blinkers turned on at the exact same time and cars started to merge
into the right two lanes. From 10k feet up i bet that looks pretty wild. You
hear an automated voice. All cars put on their blinker at the same time to break off
from the highway to head to the same destination. 

So. I'm here to talk about Design systems, Css, Js and of course Css in Js.
And what does that look like if we as a community try to think at 10k feet?

A guy I collaborate with that goes by the name John Otander (@4lpine) is pretty
good at thinking at 10k feet. He comes up with wild ideas. He decided to
download the css for top million websites, in 1 month intervals, dating back to
2005 (If available).

My first thought was - that's pretty neat. We can show people their css graphed
out over time.

*But, again, what does it look like to see this at 10,000 feet?*

- Can analyze values and look for trends
- Find most common property value rules for given components with common class names
- Look at outliers
- Find common mistakes and try to build tools to solve them
- Could overlay other data: Browser usage, timeline of introduction of various technologies (frameworks, addiitons to the spec, etc.)
- Visualize the history of design systems. Watch how evolve over time! We can animate how values change over time. Given an array of urls, you could visualize common values for things like: type scale, colors, background colors, font-family. This can help visualize how consistently your brand is implmented across a number of different front-end code bases. Most companies have different code bases for: their marketing site, their blog, their app, docs, external status page, and potentially a number of other micro sites. Having a feedback loop of common values can be helpful when trying to standardize an existing palette, or creating a feedback loop moving forward o nif you are becoming more or less consistent.

[Style Guide Audit]

Now these are just a few ideas of what you can do. But we can take this even further.
Below is a list of css properties. I often think of css as the styling api for html. It's a lot of stuff. Especially if you're a
beginner. You can build a lot of pretty neat UI without worrying about a lot of
these properties and how they work. When I am a beginner one of the most
difficult things is figuring out what to worry about and what not to.  I can
confidently say, I've never needed to set caption-side when styling a buttonon
. Or counter-increment, or counter-reset for that matter. This doesn't mean you
should never use them, but they aren't common properties attached to button
styles.

It could potentially make front-end code more accessible for new people, if a
set of components, essentially had all of the visual styling properties
exposed, where a designer could configure the values they want to pass in.
Instead of a blank slate, they could discover common things to account for for
different components. The pseudo state :focus would be a tough thing to
intuitively account for. Offering it in configuration can at 
the very least, offer guidance of suggested things to research.

Some people (jxnblk) have told me that Component API is a horrible name for this concept and he's likely correct. Regardless I think the following statements are interesting to consider.

"By abstracting the underlying implementation and only exposing objects or actions the developer needs, an API simplifies programming."

"Thus, the design of an API attempts to provide only the tools a user would expect."

When I'm styling a button, I don't expect to use volume. Or page-break. Or a
number of other properties. The goal though is not to eliminate options, it's
to narrow focus on the essential, allowing for expansion and exploration if
necessary. But this idea defining a component API has benefits extending beyond this. 

The most influential tip on how to think about designing a component I've ever seen is from Nicole Sullivan's excellent article about the Media Object.

"When Iâ€™m building a new object, the first thing I do is to figure out which
parts are reusable components, and define what I know and do not know about
them."

"For example: Can be nested, Optional right button, Must clearfix"

- Nicole Sullivan

I think this is a good process for designing and developing components.  One of
the things I like about react + css in js, is that it really encourages this
mental workflow for me. It's really helpful to actively think and sketch out
what you know and what you don't know. This can help you build components that
are more interoperable / sharable. 

So, say we defined some scales, or options to work with for the following properties. At a global theme level.

Typography
  Font-family
  Line-height
  Type-scale
  Measure
  Weights
  Text Transform

Layout
  Spacing

Theme
  Colors
  Border Widths
  Border Colors
  Border Radii
  Box Shadows
  
Motion
  Animation speed
  Easing Functions
  Movement patterns 

Maybe this would look something like this

```js
const theme = {
  breakpoints: [
    36, 48, 64
  ],
  fontFamily:[ "Gotham", "Athelas", "'Proxima Nova'" ],
  fontSize: [
    10, 12, 14, 16, 20, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128
  ],
  fontWeight: [ 400, 600, 700 ],
  lineHeight: [1, 1.25, 1.5],
  colors: [
    { text: "#000", bg: "#fff" },
    { text: "#374047", bg: "#f8f9f9" },
    { text: "#7f8a93", bg: "#f8f9f9" },
    { text: "#0077cc", bg: "#f8f9f9" },
    { text: "#005da0", bg: "#f8f9f9" },
    { text: "#00365d", bg: "#f8f9f9" },
    { text: "#00a243", bg: "#fff" },
  ],
  borderStyle: [ 'solid', 'double', 'dotted' ],
  borderWidth: [ 0, 1, 2, 4 ],
  borderDirection: [
    'all', 
    'top',
    'bottom' 
  ],
  radii: [
    0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 9999
  ],
  space: [
    0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512
  ],
  measure: ['20em', '30em', '34em'],
  boxShadow: [ '0 0 16px rgba(0,0,0,.2)' ],
}

export default theme
```    

Some of you might have already seen a file like this before. Maybe it was a sass file. This is pretty *yawn*

Thinking about Nicole Sullivans above quote. What if I had to design a button and I wanted it to use values from our design system. We could define the styling API for a button. People love buttons. Potentially, we could define a template for buttons. It might look like this: 

```js
import theme from './theme'

const buttonThemeTemplate = {

  // Typography 
  fontFamily: [ ],
  fontSize: [ ],
  fontWeight: [ ],
  textTransform: [ ],

  // Palette
  colors: [ ],
  backgroundColors: [ ],

  // Borders
  borderColors: [ ]
  borderRadius: [ ],
  borderStyle: [ ],
  borderWidth: [ ],
  borderDirections: [ ],

  // Spacing
  paddingTop: [], 
  paddingLeft: [], 
  paddingBottom: [], 
  paddingRight: [], 

  // Hover states
  hoverColor: [ ],
  hoverBg: [ ],
  hoverBoxShadow: [ ],
  hoverBorderColor: [ ],
  hoverSize: [ ],
  
  // Focus states
  focusColor: [ ],
  focusBg: [ ],
  focusBorderColor: [ ],
  focusBoxShadow: [ ],
  focusSize: [ ],

  // Focus states
  activeColor: [ ],
  activeBg: [ ],
  activeBorderColor: [ ],
  activeBoxShadow: [ ],
  activeSize: [ ],

  transitionProperty: [ ],
  transitionDuration: [ ],
  transitionTimingFunction: [ ],
}

export default buttonThemeTemplate
``` 

Then we could define what values we want to pass in. We might pass in an entire array, declare literal values, pass in a filtered array. We have javascript. We can do whatever we want. 

```js
import theme from './theme'

const buttonTheme = {
  radii: theme.radii,
  space: [
    theme.space[3],
    theme.space[4],
  ],
  fontSize: theme.fontSize.slice(0,-8),
  fontFamily: theme.fontFamily[0],
  borderStyle: [
    theme.borderStyle[0],
    theme.borderStyle[1]
  ],
  borderWidth: theme.borderWidth,
  fontWeight: theme.fontWeight,
  colors: theme.colors,
  backgroundColors: theme.colors,

  // hover, focus, active states
  
  hoverColor: [ 
    theme.colors[0].text, 
    theme.colors[1].text 
  ],
  hoverBgColor: [ 
    theme.colors[0].bg, 
    theme.colors[0].bg 
  ],
  focusColor: [ 
    theme.colors[1].text, 
    theme.colors[1].bg 
  ],
  textTransform: ['uppercase', 'capitalized'],
  transitionProperty: ['opacity', 'color', 'background-color'],
  transitionDuration: ['.25s'],
  transitionTimingFunction: ['ease-out'],
}

export default buttonTheme
```

We could make boilerplate config files for common ui components. 

This is where I think it gets really interesting.

Now this is a system.  
This is a finite state machine. 
Finite state machines are pretty neat.

We can look at all the possible button combinations from this configuration. This simple config file generates thousands and thousands of button designs. Let's step back and think at 10 thousand feet again. 

https://examples-jchwaftrgo.now.sh

- We can show how many options a design system can generate. This can be helpful because some people feel they might be constrained by working with defined scales. This can help show how varied their visual designs can still be. 
- Find desirable regions, discover inputs for desired output. This can expose properties you might want to couple together and set rules for. Sense of proportion can change dramatically at each end of the scale.
- Select the inputs for rendering desired state
- Could a/b test design options with real user metrics 
- Team collaborative voting on which component variations
- The generated data could help train an image classifier which will in turn help existing UI auditson websites. Imagine being able to input a url and query the design with questions lke: Show me all of the buttons. Show me all of the orange buttons. Show me all link styles. 

Most importantly - we can start to quickly generate lots of design options. To test with real users. Instead of letting designs stumble across a finish line that haven't been validated.

Also I'm lazy and I don't want to design buttons anymore.
